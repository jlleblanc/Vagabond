# Vagabond

Vagabond is a personal project to learn to build a CMS in Node. **This software is by no means stable or in any shape or form production ready.** It may never end up being production ready. The API is totally unstable, dependencies will change without notice, and it will always download the latest versions of every module until something breaks so badly that I get frustrated enough to specify a version.

You get the benefit of seeing my experiments in all of their messy glory. All of the most embarrassing programming mistakes? Right there for you to see. Commit messages will be vague at best.

Enjoy the chaos!
